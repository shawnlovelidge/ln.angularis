## LLM Demonstration of Code Generation

### Prerequisites
Its important to setup the scenario for success. To do this, its important to create empty test modules; one for each code module; recursively for a give source and destination folder.

Example:
```sh
./scripts/.setup.test.cases.sh /Volumes/Development/ln.angularis/projects/core/src/lib /Volumes/Development/ln.angularis/projects/core/src/test
```

### LLM Narrowed Context
Most LLM's can be give a more narrow scope relative to the intended PROMPT. Meaning if you give the LLM context it can better infer the desired outcome stated by the PROMPT.

#### Example:

```sh
write Jest Test Case in Typescript with 100% coverage for the <<filename>> module
```
