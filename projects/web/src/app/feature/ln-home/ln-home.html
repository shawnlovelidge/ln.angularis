          Built on <i>Angular 19.0.0</i>, our component library leverages the latest
          advancements in frontend development to deliver a
          high-performance, fully interactive user experience. This library is designed to integrate
          seamlessly with Angularâ€™s
          <i>server-side rendering (SSR)</i> and <i>hydration capabilities</i>, ensuring <em>fast
            initial loads</em> and optimized rendering for modern web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, the library is structured using <i>Angular Signals</i>, allowing for <em>reactive state
            management</em> that eliminates unnecessary change detection cycles and enhances efficiency.
          Components are fully <i>hydration-aware</i>, meaning they transition seamlessly from SSR to a
          client-interactive state without losing reactivity.
          This enables near-instant rendering while preserving interactivity, even in complex UI scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          With first-class support for <i>theming, lazy loading, and tree-shaking</i>, the library enables
          developers to build
          <em>lightweight, scalable</em> applications with minimal overhead. Whether deployed on <i>server-side
            environments like Angular Universal</i>
          or client-driven single-page applications, this <i>future-ready</i> component library provides
          <i>blazing-fast, enterprise-grade UI solutions</i> for modern Angular projects.
